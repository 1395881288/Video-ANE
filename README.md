Video-ANE
=========

**Work in progress && iOS only at the moment.**

Displaying video in a AIR mobile project using Starling is complicated:
- Flash display list Video object is not efficient
- StageVideo may not have any things related to Starling on top of it.
- [VideoTexture](https://forums.adobe.com/message/6615256) are still not available on mobile.

The goal of this ANE is to display a video, on top of everything. So let's say it's a StageVideo reverse class.

The movie is [Big Buck Bunny](http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/) and the character comes from the [Citrus Engine](http://citrusengine.com).
