Video-ANE
=========

**Work in progress && iOS only at the moment.**

Displaying video in a AIAR mobile project using Starling is complicated:
- Flash display list Video object is not efficient
- StageVideo may not have any things related to Starling on top of it.

The goal of this ANE is to display a video, on top of everything. So let's say it's a StageVideo reverse class.

The movie is [Big Buck Bunny](www.bigbuckbunny.org/) and the character comes from the [Citrus Engine](http://citrusengine.com).
